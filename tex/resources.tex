\begin{boxQuote}{Paul Halmos}
    When a student comes and asks, "Should I become a mathematician?" the answer should be no.
    If you have to ask, you shouldn't even ask.
\end{boxQuote}
    \begin{boxQuote}{Paul Halmos}
    Don't just read it; fight it!
    Ask your own question, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs.
    Is the hypothesis necessary?
    Is the converse true?
    ... Where does the proof use the hypothesis?

\section{Textbooks}
\begin{boxResource}[lefthand width=5cm, sidebyside]{Hammack Book of Proof}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/Hammack_Proof}
\tcblower
Hammack's Book of Proof is a free online textbook that can be found \url{https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/}.
It is also the highest quality introduction to rigorous mathematics that I have found, and \href{https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Adopters.html}{scores of colleges} seem to agree.

    The heart of mathematics is its problems.
    \end{boxQuote}
    The Putnam Exam takes place the first Saturday of December every year.
    It is Twelve Questions across two three hour sessions.
    The exam is famously difficult, with a median score of a 0 or a 1.

    This book gives an in depth overview,
        along with hundreds of more-difficult-than-average problems across undergraduate mathematics.
    I use it to review and push myself in material I have already learned.

\begin{boxResource}{The Infinitely Large Napkin}
\begin{boxQuote}{Evan Chen}
The origin of the name “Napkin” comes from the following quote of mine.
    \begin{boxQuote}{Evan Chen}
        I’ll be eating a quick lunch with some friends of mine who are still in high school.  They’ll ask me what I’ve been up to the last few weeks, and I’ll tell them that I’ve been learning category theory. They’ll ask me what category theory is about. I tell them it’s about abstracting things by looking at just the structure-preserving morphisms between them, rather than the objects themselves. I’ll try to give them the standard example Grp, but then I’ll realize that they don’t know what a homomorphism is.  So then I’ll start trying to explain what a homomorphism is, but then I’ll remember that they haven’t learned what a group is. So then I’ll start trying to explain what a group is, but by the time I finish writing the group axioms on my napkin, they’ve already forgotten why I was talking about groups in the first place. And then it’s 1PM, people need to go places, and I can’t help but think: “Man, if I had forty hours instead of forty minutes, I bet I could actually have explained this all”.
    \end{boxQuote}
This book was initially my attempt at those forty hours, but has grown considerably since then.

Evan Chen is a Graduate Student at MIT who has been working on the Napkin for several years now.
The napkin touches every facet of undergraduate (and many parts of graduate) mathematics.

Garrity's book is a substitute for a curriculum.
Every mathematician should know every word in this book.
I personally haven't studied out of this book, but I read the introduction chapter whenever I'm starting beginning to study one of its topics.

I don't have any magical ability. I look at a problem, play with it, work out a strategy.

Terry Tao is a fields medalist, and likely the best mathematician actively researching.
Thankfully for us mere mortals, he posts his thoughts and insights on a well-maintained blog.

The thesis of the video series is that Computer Scientists are expected to use,
    but are never taught,
    a variety of tools,
    including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6Q8Na575qc}{Vim}
    \item \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q}{Bash}
    \item \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok}{Git}
\end{itemize}
Mathematicians with a command over computers are sought after, both in Academia and Industry.
The series was taught by three Graduate Students at MIT.

A problem bank that tests intuition in 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear Algebra
    \item Group Theory
    \item Ring Theory

\begin{boxResource}{Project Euler}

These problems deal with numbers that are too big to be solved by hand.
The first step is to solve the problem,
    the second is to optimize the code so that it runs as fast as possible.
It's a good site to practice the intersection between math and computer science.
