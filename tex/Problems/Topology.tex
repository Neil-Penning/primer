\begin{boxProblem}{Continuity Questions}
    \begin{boxDefinition}{}
        In a topological sense,
        a function \( f : A \to B \) is continuous iff for every open \( O \subseteq B \) we have \( \inv f(O) \) is open in \( A \).
    \end{boxDefinition}
    Let \( g : \RR \to \RR \) be a function such that if \( O \) is open in \( \RR \) then \( f(O) \) is open.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is \( g \) continuous?
        \item Let \( g \) be surjective, is \( g \) continuous?
        \item Let \( g \) be injective, is \( g \) continuous?
        \item Let \( g \) be bijective, is \( g \) continuous?
    \end{itemize}
