\begin{boxProblem}{}
    You and a friend are playing a game with a deck of cards.
    You only care about the color of the card drawn (red or black).
    You both draw a card and place it on your own forehead,
        so that each person can see the other person's card,
        but not their own.
    On the count of three,
        you both say a color at the same time.
    Both players win if either player gets the color of their own card correct.
    Both players loose if neither person gets the color of the card correct.
    You're not allowed to communicate after you draw the card,
        but you are allowed to come up with a strategy beforehand.
    Can you come up with a strategy where both players always win?
