\begin{boxProblem}{} % Website Noah Showed me
    Let \( H \) be a subgroup of \( G \) such that \( G / H \isoto \ZZ \).
    Does \( G \) have a subgroup \( N \) such that \( G / N \isoto \( \ZZ / x \ZZ \) for any \( x \in \NN \)?

\begin{boxProblem}{A Painting and Two Nails}
    You want to hang a painting by a string with two nails in such a way that removing either nail will cause the painting to fall indefinitely.

    This problem was my first exposure to Group Theory, long before I knew what a group was.
